# After discussion

- Have separate clocks for warming-up, timeout, medical timeout, between games.
- Hint: Focus on the type of clock that is running, not on the type of event that is happening.
  - The type of clock is important and MUST be noted.
- Allow attaching a comment to a **clock event**.

The type of clocks:
- HomeTimeoutClock (non repeating, max 1 minute)
- AwayTimeoutClock (non repeating, max 1 minute)
- HomeMedicalTimeoutClock (non repeating, max 10 minute)
- AwayMedicalTimeoutClock (non repeating, max 10 minute)
- WarmingUpClock (non repeating, max 2 minute)
- PlayClock (10 minute per game, but not when a player has reached more than 18 points, resets after each game)
  - Role: To determine when the expedite rule comes in to play.
  - In theory this can mean that a set of best-of 5 can take up more than 50 minutes without the expedite rule as each game takes 9:59 minutes while if the first game was over 10 minutes then it's likely the other games will reach the 10 minute mark as well (since a rally ends after 13 strokes).
- BetweenGamesClock (1 minute)

NOTE:

- ChangeSides is een term die gebruikt wordt in de laatste game om van kant te wisselen, niet gebruiken om wisselen van kant tussen de games.
